# file-management-app

### Secure File Management Application Information and Parameters

This project requires the design and development of a file management 
application that allows the secure sharing and management of files. 
The application operates in a client-server architecture where common tasks
include uploading, downloading, and deleting clientsâ€™ files from and to the
server. Clients first need to be created and managed through an LDAP
(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) server. Clients need to be authenticated
to access the server. Access control (authorization) mechanisms should be
enforced to affect what clients can do on the server. All network communication
(and its protocols) between all hosts (clients, servers) should be encrypted.
An auxiliary auditing functionality should keep track of what clients do on the
server.

### Requirements
App (file management):
- functionality (up, down, delete, view)
- authentication (LDAP)	
- authorization (access control)
- logging/auditability
- pip install rsa
- Must run and be developed in LinuxOS

### Approach
- MySQL approach for data storage/file manipulation
- Use LDAP as an Authentication and Authorization system
- Create server on home PC
- Connect to it and make sure you can see contents and access
- Maybe use OpenVPN for server security
- Change in approach to a sftp server
- LLDAP instead of openldap

key thats unique and object that represents the file
user table (name and password) and way to associate user with roles)

Think about the drawing and blowout the details of the design first
figure out what the design should be first. If web gui think about 
each one, what are the interactions and write them out. Think about 
interactions between web server and gui

## Server Process so far 

### Starting, stopping MySQL server

Start MySQL server
`systemctl start mysql`

End MySQL Server
`systemctl stop mysql`

Check Status of Server
`systemctl status mysql`

Restart MySQL Server
`systemctl restart mysql`
